`Business Management App is the 2nd project of my Bootcamp as a Front End Developer. 

Created in React 18.2
 
This app is a CRUD that allows users to manage a whole business. Specifically in this beta version users could create, read, update and delete the workers of a company. I used two API's: Reqrest and GoogleMaps. Reqrest to simulate real workers and GoogleMaps to locate them along de country.



Â¿How to run it?
1) npm install
2) npm run
