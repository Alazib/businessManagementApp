Business Management App was the 2nd project of my Bootcamp as a Front End Developer. 

Created in React 18.2
 
This app is a CRUD that allows users to manage a business to the full. In this particular beta version users could create, read, update and delete the workers of a company. I used two APIs: Reqrest (to simulate real workers) and GoogleMaps (to locate them throughout country).

Also, I gave a lot of importance to Testing, using Jest and React Testing Library, with the purpose of creating a quality app.



How to run it?

   1. npm install
   2. npm run
