Business Management App was the 2nd project of my Bootcamp as a Front End Developer. 

Created in React 18.2
 
This app is a CRUD that allows users to manage a business to the full. Specifically in this beta version users could create, read, update and delete the workers of a company. I used two API's: Reqrest and GoogleMaps. Reqrest to simulate real workers and GoogleMaps to locate them along de country.

Also, I gave a lot of importance to Testing, using Jest and React Testing Library, with the purpose of creating a quality app.



Â¿How to run it?
1) npm install
2) npm run
